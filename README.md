# Typing Challenge

This is just a simple html page that contains inline css and javascript.

## <a href="https://darshanmaradiya.github.io/TypingChallenge/">The Challenge:</a>

-   <b>You need to type letters from 'A to 'Z' in any order as fast as possible</b>
-   When you type the first letter (any letter from 'A' to 'Z'), timer will start calculating the time
-   It's okay if you press the same letter more than once by mistake, it won't be inserted if it's already there
-   For your help, letters 'A' to 'Z' are given below the textbox in white color, the typed letters get highlighted in green color so that the letters in white are the only remaining letters to be typed
-   <b>When all the letters from 'A' to 'Z' are typed, the timer will automatically be stopped and you can see time you have taken to type all the letters</b>
-   By pressing the reset button you can reset the challenge
